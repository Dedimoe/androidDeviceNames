A small Android library to get the market name of an Android device.

On many popular devices the market name of the device is not available. For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S7 the value of Build.MODEL could be "SAMSUNG-SM-G930A", "SM-G930F", "SM-G930K", "SM-G930L", etc.

This small library gets the market (consumer friendly) name of a device.
